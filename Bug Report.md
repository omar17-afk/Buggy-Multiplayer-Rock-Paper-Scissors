1. get_player_choice Function:
. Syntax Error: The .lower() method is placed incorrectly. It should be applied to the input() function to convert the user's input to lowercase.
.  Missing return statement: The return statement inside the get_player_choice function is commented out, which results in no value being returned, meaning player1_choice and player2_choice will not receive any input.

2. determine_winner Function:
. Syntax Error in if and elif condition: The condition in the if block is incomplete: if player1_choice == player2_choice. The code needs to compare the choices properly and return the correct output for a tie.
. Inconsistent return in else block: The else block is returning "Player 1 wins!" even if Player 2 wins, which is incorrect.

3. play_game Function (not fully defined):
. The function play_game() is mentioned in a comment, but it is incomplete and commented out.

4. Syntax Error It Should Be Player 2 Win not Player 1 Win

5. Missing Final Check for Running the Game:
. The check if __name__ == "__main__": is present, but the play_game() function is commented out. It should be uncommented to run the game.
